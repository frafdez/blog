# 1. Why does this problem need solving? 
Let's dive into the [WWWH](/2024/07/08/why-who-what-how-of-building-products.html) of building a product...

We often assume our problems are universal and jump into building a product without fully understanding why the problem needs solving. The "why" is the most critical question to ask yourself, even more so than the "what". If you can't answer this first question, it isn't worth building the product.
Consider a hypothetical example for a product like Notion:

"Many professionals and organizations require a versatile tool that combines note-taking, task management, and database functions in a single platform. Existing solutions often lack the flexibility and integration needed for seamless workflow management."
