title: What no one wants to admit about development timelines & estimates...

Development projects often take longer than expected, and it's crucial for non-technical stakeholders to set realistic timelines. For those new to the tech industry, **a good rule of thumb is to add 50% to initial estimates** provided by developers. While this might seem excessive, it accounts for various unforeseen challenges that developers face. 

**Hereâ€™s why**:

**The Puzzle Analogy**: Developing a product is like assembling a unique jigsaw puzzle. Even experienced developers encounter new and complex pieces in each project, requiring thorough research to navigate these challenges. This research phase is crucial and time-consuming, reminiscent of why engineering departments were traditionally called R&D (Research and Development)

**Problem-Solving in Real-Time**: When issues arise, it takes time to diagnose and address them correctly. Junior developers might offer quick, superficial fixes to stop immediate problems, but sustainable solutions often require significant code refactoring or rewriting. This process ensures long-term stability and functionality.

As your development team gains experience, **the buffer can be reduced to around 25%**. However, if your team consistently meets their estimates without adjustments, it might indicate they are padding their estimates. Encouraging aggressive yet realistic timelines ensures your developers remain motivated and perform at their best, ultimately providing greater value to your customers.

By understanding these factors, non-technical professionals can better align expectations and foster more effective collaboration with their tech teams.
