AI tools have created a fascinating paradox in software development: they can explain complex algorithms with PhD-level precision but struggle to remember the specifics of your company's codebase for more than a few minutes.

A developer on Reddit called this the "PhD with a goldfish memory" problem - AI can recite textbook knowledge flawlessly but forgets your project's context almost immediately.

This is like having a brilliant consultant who can quote industry best practices verbatim but keeps forgetting your company's name between meetings. The theoretical knowledge is impeccable, but the contextual awareness is fleeting.

The solution isn't abandoning AI coding assistants but recognizing their limitations. The most effective developers use AI for algorithm design and boilerplate generation while maintaining human oversight for architectural decisions and contextual understanding.
