If you’re “vibe coding” and wondering why the devs in your life sometimes groan at AI code suggestions, it often boils down to something it does poorly called polymorphism.

Think of it like this:

Good polymorphism: You tell a person to “speak” and they say something in their own voice.
Bad (non) polymorphism: You write a giant list of “if the person is a bird, chirp… if they’re a dog, bark… if their hat is blue, do something else…” and eventually humans start barking and chirping.

That is why devs lose it when they see certain AI code. It is like finding "Bark!" buried at the bottom of 200 lines of if/else statements.
