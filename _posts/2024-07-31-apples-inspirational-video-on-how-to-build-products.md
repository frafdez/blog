> If everyone  
is busy making everything  
how can anyone perfect anything?  
we start to confuse convenience  
with joy  
abundance with choice.  
Designing something requires  
focus  
the first thing we ask is  
what do we want people to feel?  
Delight  
Surprise  
Love  
Connection  
then we begin to craft around our intention  
it takes time.  
There are a thousand noâ€™s  
for every yes.  
we simplify  
we perfect  
we start over  
until every thing we touch  
enhances each life  
it touches.  
only then do we sign our work.
