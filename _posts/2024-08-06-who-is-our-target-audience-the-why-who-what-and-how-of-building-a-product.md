# 2. Who is our target audience?
If you've already answered ["Why does this problem need solving?"](/2024/07/26/why-does-this-problem-need-solving-the-why-who-what-and-how-of-building-a-product.html) then you need to ask who the target audience is...

Your target audience comprises the people who will buy your product, not just those who might buy it. Although it is the second most important question, it is usually answered along with the first question. If you know why a problem needs solving, then you should know who needs it. This might sound like a logical next step, but most people skip this step, thinking they already know the answer. Sometimes it's because they are their own target audience. "If I want it, others will too," which is similar to "If you build it, they will come." Who are the others that will come? How sure are you that they will?

If you can't answer that, then who will pay for your product or service? Even altruistic ventures need audiences. Why would you build something that nobody wants?
