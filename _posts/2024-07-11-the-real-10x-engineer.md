# The Real 10X Engineer...
- Is a person who tests their own code before they deploy to avoid the issues instead of relying on someone else to test it.
- Knows when to make tradeoffs that will add technical debt and little by little reduce the debt without you noticing. 
- Knows how to spend your budget rather than run up your AWS or GCP bill. If they do, they take responsibility and make it right. 
- Thinks through the issues and anticipate change even if it never comes. That’s called architectural design.
- Doesn't go home and shutdown their brains. They are always thinking about the problems they need to solve. 
- Will be humble because they know that they don’t know everything and are constantly trying to improve. 

Most importantly, a real 10X engineers is not primarily there for the pay, but because they care about what they are building.
