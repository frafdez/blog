When building a product or service, aim to make it indispensable and effortless. It should be as essential as any home utility – think electricity or water. Your offering should be a "must-have," not just a "nice-to-have."

✅ It should just work.  
✅ It should be painful to lose.  
✅ Switching to another product or service should feel impossible.  

Strive for this level of integration and necessity, and your product or service will become a seamless part of your customers' lives.
